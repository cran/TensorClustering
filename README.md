<!-- badges: end -->

Performs model-based tensor clustering methods including the Tensor
Envelope Mixture Model (**TEMM**), Doubly-Enhanced EM (**DEEM**)
algorithm and Tensor Gaussian Mixture Model (**TGMM**). TEMM is from the
paper “Tensor Envelope Mixture Model For Simultaneous Clustering and
Multiway Dimension Reduction” by Deng and Zhang. DEEM is from the paper
“A Doubly-Enhanced EM Algorithm for Model-Based Tensor Clustering” by
Mai, Zhang, Pan and Deng.

Installation
------------

The **TensorClustering** package can be installed, directly from
**GitHub**, using the **devtools** library:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("azuryee/TensorClustering")
library(TensorClustering)
```
